        <strong> <u>PRICING</u>.</strong>
      </li>
    </ol>
    3.1 Customer payments (the “Payments”) shall be collected by the Company and
    processed via a gateway of our choosing which is currently Stripe. The
    Customer may also opt in to process payments with their preferred gateway
    for an additional monthly fee. 3.2 The Company fee is a percentage based on
    an aforementioned agreement between the Company and the Service Provider
    based on the gross order amount, minus the processing and shipping fees.
    There is an additional two and nine-tenth percent (2.9%) and .30 cents
    credit card processing fee per transaction if the Customer is using the
    standard Stripe payment processing. 3.3 100% minus 2.9% and .30 cents plus
    the transaction fee percentage agreed upon by the Company and the Service
    Provider shall be paid to Service Provider at the time of payment by the
    customer. 3.4 Pricing is subject to change at the discretion of the Company
    upon sixty (60) days’ written notice to Service Provider. 3.5 The Customer
    may also choose to pay a flat monthly fee based on the amount of monthly
    orders collected, with no additional percentage per transaction with the
    exception of credit card processing fees from Stripe or the Customer’s
    preferred payment processor. Flat monthly fees are billed automatically from
    the Customer’s connected Stripe account balance per month. 3.6 A Customer
    may also choose to pay a flat rate for an extended period of time, such as
    three months, six months, or one year. In this case the Customer must pay
    the agreed upon amount at the commencement of the contract for access to the
    Service Provider’s platform for the agreed upon amount of time. The Customer
    will be charged recurringly after the agreed upon duration of time has
    expired. Any cancellation of services before the duration has expired does
    not warrant a refund.
